### Why I wanted to learn programming
There are a few reasons why I decided on this particular career. To name one in particular, towards the end of last year, I started to reevaluate my current career journey and my priorities. I knew that I wanted to go back to school to get my degree, after having to drop out twice for personal reasons. I also knew that I wanted to get a career that could afford me the oppurtunity in the field I am most passionate about, psychology. After countless of hours in research and bouncing ideas off of my fiance, the one degree that made the most sense was Web Development. So here I am after quitting my beloved job, in pursuit of a new career with no regrets! 😅
